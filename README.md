# TP_MLOPS
this is the MLOPS TP


Note : I use firefox, and the unit test doesnt work. 
I got the message : "  console.log
    The geckodriver.exe executable could not be found on the current PATH, trying Selenium Manager at findGeckoDriver (node_modules/selenium-webdriver/firefox.js:465:13)"

I tried to download it on my computer, but it does not work

But when I execute the test on another computer with chrome, it works.


Futhemore, the timeout function is not workind. So I modify the test system in the config file of the frontend.
